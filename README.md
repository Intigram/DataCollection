# Data Collection

Here you can find all the scripts used for collecting and extracting data, along with two sample responses, from a match's final data and timeline, on ```sample_match_match_id.json``` and ```sample_match_timeline.json```, respectively.

The whole data collected can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chiniczr/league-of-legends-summoners-and-match-data">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chiniczr/league-of-legends-summoners-and-match-data</a>.
